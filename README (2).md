# Credit Card Fraud Detection Data Analytics Project




## Overview 

The GitHub repository dedicated to the research on Credit Card Fraud Detection. This project encompasses code, resources, and findings focused on comparing and evaluating four machine learning models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of credit card fraud detection.
## Contents

1.Literature Review: This PDF covers various studies and methods used in the field.  

2.Initial Results and Code Notebook: Explore the code and initial findings in this  notebook. It includes how I developed models and evaluated their performance in detecting credit card fraud.  

3.Supplementary Document for Initial Results and Code: A handy PDF that comes with additional information to complement the code and initial findings notebook. Use it as a reference guide. 
## Key Objectives:

Research Objectives: Define the purpose and objectives of the research project. 

Data Collection: Collect,clean, and ensure the integrity of the dataset. 

Initial Analysis: Review and prepare the collected data for further analysis. 

Exploratory Analysis: Conduct detailed analysis to understand patterns and relationships within the data.  

Feature scaling: Feature scaling is important to ensure that all features have the same scale. This is done using a robust scaler. 

Model Training: Once the data is prepared, we can train a fraud detection model. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for fraud detection, such as logistic regression, random forests etc. 

I have used logistic regression, Random forest. naive bayes and decision tree 

Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it is important to evaluate its performance on a held-out test set. The performance metrics and their detailed analysis/insights are shared in the notebook 

This dataset can be used to train and evaluate fraud detection models. It is important to note that the dataset is highly imbalanced, se we have use Stratified KFold Cross Validation with k=5 while training the models.
## Dataset 


The dataset used in this research is downloaded from Kaggle. If anyone wishes to access it, they can download it from the Kaggle platform. Kaggle Dataset:
